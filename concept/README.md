# Web3 browser concept

PoC is implemented using chrome extensions and bookmarks bar. In order to experience something close to web3 experience you need to install.

## IPFS first
You need to install IPFS daemon first, run:
`brew install ipfs`
`brew services start ipfs`

IPFS will start run in background even after reboot. Don't worry it must not eat a lot of your resources.

To make it better work in browser install [IPFS companion](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ipfs-companion/nibjojkomfdiaoajekhjakgkdhaomnch?hl=en).

## Add UX
