# 1. Main Page

**Purpose:** the main purpose of this page is to accent the user's attention to search function. 

**Design  features:** design should be simple and attractive.

There is a status text below search panel which describes technical information about cyber.Search products:

**_Search in 134 M transactions in 2 blockchain systems with 135 parsed tokens. Database size : 369 GBs_** 

where transactions are the number of all indexed transactions from all blockchains connected to Cybernode, blockchain systems - all blockchains processed by Cybernode, tokens - all unique tokens from all blockchains that are listed in Chaingear, database size - size of Cybernode database.

There are 3 main widgets below the status string describing the cryptoeconomy, registers and portfolio:

2. Chaingear registers - number of created registers in Chaingear.

2. Roadmap - roadmap of all cyber.Search projects
3. Cybernode - Cybeernode landing page
4. Dashboard - a link user's custom dashboard
