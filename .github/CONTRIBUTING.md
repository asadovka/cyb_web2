# Contributing rules

Want to contribute to Congress? Awesome! We love contributions from everyone. Let us propose you the best ways for contributing. It makes your help really useful!

This guide explains how to:

- Get started
- Use development workflow
- Get help if you encounter trouble

## Opening issues

**Open an issue** to report bugs or to propose new features. Also we offer to use our issue templates according to problem types.

>Note: the problem will be solved as quickly as it is clearly described.

## Development workflow

>ToDo. Customize it according to your project.

## Proposing pull request


Pull requests are very welcome.

>Note that if you are going to propose drastic changes, be sure to open an issue for discussion first, to make sure that your PR will be accepted before you spend effort coding it.

It's better for us if you will open your pull request by following steps:

- open an issue in which you are interested;
- fork the repo and create your branch from `master`;
- play with it and make significant things;
- if you've added code that should be tested, add tests;
- if you've changed APIs, update the documentation;
- ensure the test suite passes;
- open pull request and write good commit message;

For example:

```
#123 Refactor CONTRIBUTING.md

--Add Creating Commits And Writing Commit Messages Section
--Another Section
```
- submit PR;

Before we can merge the contribution we need to discuss changes. It's normal that this takes several iterations, so don't get discouraged by change requests. They ensure the high quality that we all enjoy.
