# Overview

Cyb is a blockchain browser with integrated DApp platform. Browser consists of two main parts:

1. Shell, which alows:

- search in blockchains and Dapps, and IPFS content
- deploy and manage Dapps for users
- show desync state of user and blockchain
- manage user's account data (sign transactions, create custom feed)

2. DApps, which:

- use cyber.Search services for data obtaining (cyber.Search, cyber.Markets, cybernode)
- are stored in IPFS
- can interract with user and each other


# Principles

There are sereral key principles of cyb behavior, design and development.


## 1. Users

We focus on developers and advanced blockchain users (Metamask users). But cyb is also friendly for everyone who wants to interract with blockchains and decentralized systems.

### 1.1. User activity types

We respect user's attitude and principles. So we offer 3 clear custom types of user behavior:

- public activity [address + events tracking]
- private activity [abstract ID + events tracking ]
- anonymous activity [no tracking at all]

For successful browser development we need to collect at least public and private data. Thus users of these 2 groups well be incentivized by giving nice perks.

### 1.2 User activity incentivization

We use full tokenization of processes (data obtain and transfer, content generation and adding).

### 1.3 Contribution

### 1.4 Donation mechanism

### 1.5 Feeedback and bug collection

We use user's feedback to make products better. So we provide options for bug reporting and feedback leaving on every page.


## 2. Design

Cyb design process follows Web3 design principles

### 2.1. State rules

We use simple colored states for states of transactions or operations:

- mempool/failed - red
- confirmed/reverted - yellow
- finalized/succesful - green

### 2.2 Data visualisation

Data should be visualised in a simple and attractive way. No overloaded plots an diagrams, we use animation instead.

### 2.3 Blockchain objects presenting

Blockchain data is too complicated and sometimes not obvious for people. Thus we use adaptive tricks to make work process more convenient:

1. Logical grouping for objects. Every app page has common groups of data (general, blockchain specific) for inheritance of views and better navigation or data observing.
2. Classical accounting terms used for balance and cashflow operations. Blockahains use econimic principles for interaction between subjects thus we can describe such processes in established terms.
3. Robohash logo for contracts entities. Contracts can act by themself, have and algorithms, so it's more natural to perceive them like robots instead of pieces of code.
