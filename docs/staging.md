**Staging server**: staging.cyber.fund

### Starting

Need to start 4 components:

- cyber-ui (cui-browser)
- cyber-search (https://github.com/cyberFund/cyber-search/tree/chain_pump/devops/pumps - `docker-compose.yml`)
- cyber-markets ???
- chaingear-api ???

This only starts containers from DockerHub. It doesn't rebuild them. Rebuilding is another step.

### Rebuilding

TODO: Move stuff out of CircleCI configs into build scripts + conventions.
