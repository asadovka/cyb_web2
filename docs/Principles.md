# Principles

The main purpose of this document is to describe the key principles of design and development of cyber.Browser.

## 1. Business goals

- Lead users to make payable actions (create registry, develop custom browser app, pay for developing functionality)
- Attract mimimum 100 000 active users till token distribution

## 2. Business rules

- Focusing on developers and Metamask users
- Developing in terms of web 3.0 principles
- Full tokenization of economy processes (valuation, transfering data)
- Collect feedback and create analytics with use of instruments that aviod collect personal data

## 3. User policy

### 3.1. User activity

We respect user's attitude and principles. So we offer 3 clear custom types of tracking activity:

- public activity [address + events tracking] - surep perk
- private activity [only events + abstract address tracking] - simple perk
- anonimous activity [no tracking at all]

For successful browser development we need to collect at least public and private data. Thus users of these 2 groups well be incentivized by giving nice perks


## 4. Design 

### 4.1. State rules

We use simple colored states for states of transactions or operations:

- mempool/failed - red
- confirmed/reverted - yellow
- finalized/succesful - green

### 4.2 Data visualisation

Data should be visualised in a simple and attractive way. No overloaded plots an diagrams, we use animation instead.

### 4.3 Blockchain objects presenting

Blockchain data is too complicated and sometimes not obvious for people. Thus we use adaptive tricks to make work process more convenient:
