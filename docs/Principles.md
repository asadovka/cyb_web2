# Principles

The main purpose of this document is to describe the key principles of design and development of cyber.Browser.



## 1. Business goals

- Lead users to make payable actions (create registry, develop custom browser app, pay for developing functionality)
- Attract mimimum 100 000 active users till token distribution



## 2. Business rules

- Focusing on developers and Metamask users
- Developing in terms of web 3.0 principles
- Full tokenization of economy processes (valuation, transfering data)



## 3. User policy

### 3.1. User activity

We respect user's attitude and principles. So we offer 3 clear custom types of tracking activity:

- public activity [address + events tracking] - surep perk
- private activity [only events + abstract address tracking] - simple perk
- anonimous activity [no tracking at all]

For successful browser development we need to collect at least public and private data. Thus users of these 2 groups well be incentivized by giving nice perks.

### 3.2 Feeedback and bug collection

We use user's feedback to make products better. So we provide options for bug reporting and feedback leaving on every page.



## 4. Design 

### 4.1. State rules

We use simple colored states for states of transactions or operations:

- mempool/failed - red
- confirmed/reverted - yellow
- finalized/succesful - green

### 4.2 Data visualisation

Data should be visualised in a simple and attractive way. No overloaded plots an diagrams, we use animation instead.

### 4.3 Blockchain objects presenting

Blockchain data is too complicated and sometimes not obvious for people. Thus we use adaptive tricks to make work process more convenient:

1. Logical grouping for objects. Every page has common groups of data (general, specific, transaction tables) for better navigation and data observing.
2. Classical accounting terms used for balance and cashflow operations. Blockahains use econimic principles for interaction between subjects thus we can describe such processes in established terms.
3. Robohash logo for contracts entities. Contracts can act by themself, have and algorithms, so it's more natural to perceive them like robots instead of pieces of code. 


## 5. Development
